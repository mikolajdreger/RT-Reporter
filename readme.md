RT-Reporter is a tool dedicated to creating reports in PDF format for the Request Tracker tool - a tool dedicated to handling tickets, in the case of SOC/CERT teams to respond to security incidents. The RT-Reporter tool is built based on Flask and HTML and CSS. The version presented in this repository creates a simple summary of handled incidents in the time period declared by the user.
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
